# Guess-The-Quote-Game

Just as you thought guessing a quote isn't enough you create a number guessing game. I guess I like guessing games too much.

This is the first project in which I utilize object-oriented programming in my program.

## Executions

Execute the guessing game
```
python3 guessTheNumber.py
```
